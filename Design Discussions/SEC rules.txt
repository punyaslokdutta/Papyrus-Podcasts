SECURITY RULES:


-> Have to incorporate a rule in Security Rules that writing to podcast Document in whole is only limited to the podcasterID & the userIDs in adminList.[IMPORTANT] 
     Other than this, since partial writing permissions are allowed, only numUsersLiked & numUsersReweeted fields shall be given writing rights by all users.
    

   SO, for adding someone as admin, 2  places we have to make changes:-
	(i) 'isAdmin’ boolean field in user’s privateDoc.
	(ii) userID has to be added to the adminList used in Security Rules.

   allow read, write; // or allow read, write: if true;
      }
     
     match /{path=**}/Podcasts/{PodcastID} {
      allow read: if request.auth.uid != null;
    }
