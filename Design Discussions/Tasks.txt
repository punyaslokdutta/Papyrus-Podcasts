5.	

Tasks for 03/10/2020:-
1.	After completion of tasks below related to Video, 
a.	Start replacing props.navigation.navigate with props.navigation.push wherever you are losing context
i.	For example:- When clicking the User picture in ActivityItem, we move to ExploreTabNavigator but we don’t come back to ActivityScreen when coming back from there & hence, we lose context.
2.	Have to provide video as well as photos for adding in AddFlipScreen & accordingly either play the video or simply show the photo in the preview area in AddFlipScreen.
a.	Tasks for 08/10/2020 for this task are written in AddFlipScreen
i.	Option for image or video upload
ii.	Upload thumbnail Image of video to firebase & use it’s download URL instead of using local path.
b.	Test on debug database by uploading some flips - both normal & audio.
c.	Look at something on Video Resizing
3.	Have to show user’s DP when user disables his video
a.	To user himself [DONE]
b.	To other users
i.	Have to use callback - RemoteVideoStateChanged
4.	[FACT] In order to make a view transparent, we need 2 things -
a.	backgroundColor : ‘transparent’
b.	position : ‘absolute’
5.	[FACT] To use “this” keyword inside a nested promise, always declare 
     var that = this;
at the beginning of the function & then, use that.fun() instead of this.fun() inside a nested then statement.

Tasks for 02/10/2020:-
1.	Check once & push to gitlab.
2.	Request Camera & MIcrophone permission when user enters VideoChatScreen from ActivityItem press.
a.	[SOLUTION] Checked the permissions on click of ActivityItem itself.
3.	[BUG] There existed another problem related to joining a video call from ActivityItem, which was that
a.	Only when entering the VIdeoChatScreen for the 1st time from ActivityItem, the user was able to enter the call.
b.	After that, we had to keep some check in componentDidUpdate in order to joinCHannel().
c.	[SOLUTION] In componentDidUpdate, based on the param fromActivity, joinCHannel() was called & after joining Channel, 
       this.props.navigation.setParams({ fromActivity : false })
d.	The above was added because after leaving discussion &  navigating back from VideoChatScreen, componentDidUpdate was called again & with the same params,i.e, fromActivity = true, the joinCHannel() was called again.
e.	Need to check this in release mode.[DONE]
4.	Show users who have already joined as & when they join.
a.	A user needs to join a channel if they want to know which other user has joined the channel.
b.	Because of the above, it maybe the case that we have to make user join channel on Inviting 1st participant itself, but not show the renderVideos Section yet.
c.	Basically joinSucceed state variable needs to be maintained a bit differently when currUID = 1, so that only on press of STart Call we show renderVideos, but the initiator joins channel before hand.
5.	[BUG] On pressing conversation in ProfileConversations, most of the times, app is crashing
a.	Maybe due to statusBar inclusion.Try removing it.
b.	Last day, I thought it was because of listener, but even that does not seem to be the case.
c.	You can try navigating to a more static screen & build up from there in order to find out what the problem is.
d.	[SOLUTION] By using option “c” above, it was found that the FlatList is the thing causing the problem. ← Still don’t know the exact feature in FlatList which is causing this.
i.	Tried using Animated.FlatList & useNativeDriver = True in onScroll, but to no avail.
ii.	WIll come back to this, once we have a lot of content & including this becomes necessary.
iii.	Although, the main reason for building TikTok Scroll is because users are highly familiar with this type of UI/UX when watching videos (e.g - Instagram,Facebook,TikTok,Rizzle & so on)
iv.	For now, Have kept a single VideoItem in VideoScreen.
6.	Rotate Camera feature.
a.	Completed using the line - 
await this._engine.switchCamera()
b.	Only have to now keep this feature in proper position. Also, a single button would suffice. No need to maintain state.
7.	Mic on/off & Video on/off feature
a.	Mic on/off
i.	DISABLE     await this._engine.enableLocalAudio(false)
ii.	ENABLE     await this._engine.enableLocalAudio(true)
b.	Video on/off feature
i.	DISABLE     await this._engine.enableLocalVideo(false)
ii.	ENABLE     await this._engine.enableLocalVideo(true)
c.	Task left here:- [DONE]
i.	Position the necessary icons
ii.	Maintain state for mic & video on/off
8.	On tapping participant’s small square, the participant’s & the user’s square should be swapped so that the participant comes onto the big square & vice-versa.

i.	1st, one-to-one [DONE] & then,
ii.	3 people.
9.	Adding media during Video call.
a.	Can provide this menu in renderCallMenu so as to search for flips.
b.	Have to discuss with Satyam if this should be there only before starting a conversation or in the middle of the conversation as well.
c.	Flips have to be indexed for this purpose.
10.	[BUG] The 2nd participant added is given channelX (default channel) in it’s activity.
a.	 This should not be a problem. As the appropriate channelName is sent to the participants when I tested it on recent build.
b.	Have to check with 1.0.28 Internal version once debugging is done. 

Tasks for 29/09/2020:-
1.	Add VideoChatScreen to the RecordStackNavigator.[Can be done at last]
2.	Add Discussion Topic,Genre & media(make it optional) & after filling all those allow the user to press INVITE PARTICIPANTS & add the above fields to the concerned document [DONE]
3.	Remove the acquire button & perform the acquire with the press of start button & follow it up with a start call. [DONE]
a.	Take a note of the time lag in opening of Video. [No noticeable time lag]
4.	Take camera, microphone & storage permission before doing anything after START button press. [DONE]

7.	On press of a particular item in convos section, the corresponding videoItem should open in VideoScreen. (HINT: use the scrollToIndex function as used in FLipsScreenVertical) [DONE]
8.	Remove the things from editProfile Screen after taking all this to RecordStackNavigator.
9.	RELEASE to INTERNAL 1.0.28

Tasks for 27/09/2020:-
1.	Initiator’s name should be written once & never forgotten.
a.	We can actually keep channel name same as the conversation document.
i.	[IMPORTANT] → A conversation cannot be initiated without INVITING at least 1 user.
ii.	So, basically, whenever a user invites the very 1st participant at that moment,a conversation document will be created & since the firebase document IDs are unique, we can use them as the channelName when we start our call.
iii.	Therefore, after inviting the very 1st participant, 
1.	1st, conversation document is to be added with simply some basic fields:-
a.	videoCallInitiatorID - 
b.	conversationID - 
2.	After adding, the conversationID is to be used as channelName in Agora & thus start the call at Agora & correspondingly, call both acquire & start APIs, one after the other for cloud recording.
3.	After call is started, START CALL is to be removed for all users.
iv.	For other participants, in place of END CALL, it would be LEAVE CALL.
v.	On initiator pressing END CALL, other users shall get a notification that the initiator has ended the call in UserOffline event.
vi.	Upon receiving the notification, a Toast will be shown saying that - “The call has ended.” & also the other users’ endCall function shall be called which shall move other users out of the renderVideos function.
vii.	On END CALL, the m3u8 file shall be uploaded to the conversation document.
2.	TASKS:-
a.	Request Permission before starting/joining the video call.
b.	

Tasks for 21/09/2020:-
1.	Agora recording not able to do
a.	Issue in Environment configuration of Postman
b.	HAVE raised a ticket describing the exact problem [DONE on 22/09/2020 11:35 AM] → Keep an eye on this for any response from Agora Support
c.	Albert Fang from Agora Support responded with the solution:-
i.	channelType - 0 (for video call) &
ii.	Recording UID should be different than the all the other UIDs in the channel.
iii.	Ticket raised in this context:-
https://agora-ticket.agora.io/issue/e63c7ae4-f4fc-437f-a757-17cae75a7426
d.	Next Task → Run react-native-agora in Papyrus release database & create a section for recorded conversations.
i.	Call cloud functions from react-native in order to call the RESTful APIs for cloud recording [DONE](acquire,start,stop,query,updateLayout)
ii.	On Start Call by host(or 1st caller), call the acquire & start RESTful APIs from cloud functions.
iii.	On End Call by host(or 1st caller), call the stop RESTful API from cloud functions.
iv.	Find out where the Amazon S3 URL for recorded video can be retrieved.
1.	Maybe have to make S3 bucket public.
2.	Maybe it comes in query API.
3.	Maybe have to set callback in cloud functions to receive URL.
v.	Fetch the URL & add a document for Conversations collection with other important files.
vi.	FInd out how it is decided to break a file & learn about recording modes - mix & individual.
1.	M3u8 & .ts files → Notice the difference.
2.	M3u8 file contains the proper way to play the ts files with the same name(1st part) & same directory as the m3u8 file.
2.	Error in deploying cloud functions in DEBUG database
a.	Have to contact firebase team for the link they were saying they shall provide for paying 700 Rs.(10$) [22nd September 2020 → 8 AM]
b.	It maybe the case that the problem for cloud functions is persisting because of this.
c.	[SOLUTION] -> Yes, indeed the problem for cloud functions was because of non-payment of September charges for fa45c database.
d.	PAYMENT of 10 Rs. done using HSBC debit card.
3.	BUG in main app → Some problem with Google cloud storage for 274618 database as we are having problem in recording or including images.
a.	Actually, the problem was with 1.0.27, API LEVEL 29 SDK was installed & included as Google Play Console mandated it.
b.	The solution was using      android:requestLegacyExternalStorage="true" in application tag in AndroidManifest.xml


Tasks for 08/09/2020:-
1.	MAIN TASK
a.	Most probably, we have to call the RESTful API from cloud functions because they have mentioned in the documentation that we need to call the API from app server.
b.	So, in the example app, where Agora video call is working, there, for now, the tasks for me are:-
i.	When “Start Call” is pressed, along with the video call starting, the Agora RESTful API for cloud recording will also be called so that recording may start.
In production, I’ll have to call a cloud function & from there, I’ll have to call the REST API..but for now..have to try to call REST API from client itself to see if it is working or not.
ii.	Create an AWS account so that we can store the recorded video to S3 storage.
iii.	Check whether the whole video call is stored on S3 storage or not.

Tasks for 07/09/2020:-
1.	After 9 AM, call customer care support for HSBC credit card.
a.	What to ask:-
i.	Is there a minimum amount which can be cut & what to do if the amount has to be deducted or else the firebase project for fa45c would be terminated?
b.	You can call Rahul HSBC maybe if you don’t find any customer care numbers for HSBC credit card.
c.	SOLUTION:-
i.	So, I enquired with both HSBC & Google cloud Platform & it turned out to be a Minimum Amount Problem from Google Cloud Platform’s side.
ii.	Basically, Google cloud Platform has a policy that a minimum of 10$ has to be paid even though the bill is only of 1 Rs.
iii.	Therefore, by 08/09/2020, I’ll receive an email from Google Cloud Support, Kierlyn for paying a minimum of 10$.

2.	Agora.io cloud recording & S3 storage [MAIN TASK]
a.	Have to explore from where exactly do we need to call the record API → Cloud Functions or client?
b.	Background:- For using Agora API for cloud recording, their documentation only involves RESTful API documentation & no React-native documentation. From this, it is clear that we have to use the REST API only. 
For using the REST API, we have to use app secret & app ID.
c.	Now, can we expose app secret just like we used the search-only key for Algolia??
3.	Some BUGS:-
a.	Pictures in EditBackgroundMusic.js are of large size. That’s why they take time to render when 1st opened.
i.	May have to reduce the size of pictures.
b.	scrollPosition setting for Explore Flips & Profile Screen Flips so as to reach proper depth in FlipsScreenVertical - like screens.
c.	ActivityIndicator when loading new image while scrolling in Horizontal Flatlist.
4.	Even after performing certain optimizations, Papyrus v1.0.27 is getting slow on both of Baba’s phone due to HomeScreen ← Have to DEBUG.
5.	Also, in CustomDrawerContentComponent, the height is set not relative Dimensions.height , but absolute values ← Because of this, we are not able to see version.
6.	HEIGHT problem for the player on not only ONEPLUS, but also on both of Baba’s phones.

BUGS:-
Edit by admin not working
-	 Solved (Actually, it is working...I had not set myself as admin in customUserClaims)

c.	    else if(playbackState == TrackPlayer.STATE_STOPPED){
d.	     dispatch({type:"SET_PAUSED", payload:true});

22/08/2020:-
1.	Database Structure Change Document added in Google Docs for swayamdutta@papyruspodcasts.com [DONE]
2.	UPDATE button design change. - DONE
a.	After next Beta update, the Beta users will be asked to delete the app & install again..since they won’t have the client code to show the UPDATE button.
b.	Until then ,the updateMessage in firestore collection “appUpdates” will be same as now,i.e, Delete the app & install again.
c.	After 5-6 days of next Beta release after we tell everybody to update the app, the message can be changed to simply “New Update available”.
d.	Also, we have to think about unForcedUpdate OR
HOW does Insstagram do auto-update???
e.	SO, auto-update is an option present in Playstore app for any android device.
f.	It may take upto 1 day for all users to have the current update
g.	[SOLUTION] - [Have to do below in Release]
i.	Have to use a combination of react-native-version-check(RNVC) & our own version check from firestore
ii.	If both show the latest version to be equal, then we show the UPDATE page
iii.	If RNVC shows that latestappversion is different than current app version, but firestore doesn’t say so, then we can show not show anything at all, because this situation may arise only when RNVC is showing a version upgrade when indeed there is none or when there is an upgrade available but latestappversion is not updated in firestore.
iv.	If firestore says that update is visible but RNVC disagrees then it means that the update has not yet reached the device of the user OR playstore has not reset it’s cache although the developers have released a new version in Playstore. IN SUCH A CASE, we show nothing & let users use the previous version until RNVC says that there is a new version available.
v.	Although for the last case in (iv), if we require forced update, we can stop the user from using the app by showing the update page & directing user to clear cache of playstore if no update is available.

21/08/2020:-
1.	Image Viewer for images [PanZoom]
a.	Used ImageZoom from react-native-image-pan-zoom
b.	Used in InfoScreen,MainFlipItem,FlipItem,Podcast,RecordBook & RecordChapter
c.	DONE
d.	Verify for multiple pictures in [RELEASE Database]
i.	RecordBook (Checked in DEBUG - working, but sometime zooming into corner areas is a bit difficult) & RecordChapter
ii.	InfoScreen [Same problem as in Recordchapter]
2.	Like, share in MainFlipItem with likes count [Normal]
a.	Like - DONE - Verified
b.	Share - DONE - will verify on release database.
3.	Issue in playing audio inside MainFlipItem [Have to reproduce in Satyam’s phone 1 time] ← not reproducible
4.	Sometimes, the play or pause icon disappears from MainFlipItem ← not reproducible
5.	FlipItem play/pause/loading problem arises when user continuously keeps on pressing the same icon ← not reproducible
6.	Continue Listening not working in release mode (working in debug mode most probably because of lag)
a.	[SOLUTION] → Provided a setTimeout after TrackPlayer seeks to the lastPlayedPosition (PodcastContent useEffect of playbackState) → THIS is not the solution. It seems the original code that was there in internal, that was not seeking to lastPlayedPosition, magically started to work after 1 day..although it is only client-side library(react-native-track-player). So, reverted this solution as original code(without timeout) is working in release mode.
7.	Tooltip needs to be changed with curved implementation like in GPay. 
a.	See if original tooltip for a new user if its properly working in release mode …
b.	IF problem exists, then have to keep timeouts
8.	Double sided bars not coming in all Podcast.js components except the one in your collections. (in Oneplus till now) - DONE - verified

5.	BUGS in 1.0.24 → renderDots not working properly in FlipItem & MainFlipItem. ← not experiencing this as of 24/08/2020 in release internaltest version 1.0.24
6.	BookName font in MainFlipItem has to be changed. - DONE - verified

2.	Shimmer for explore

17/08/2020:-

1.	After exiting app & reenter audio’s state should be maintained.
a.	Detect TrackPlayer’s state & if it’s playing, then extract the podcast by querying it by it’s podcastID stored in Track. [Has to be done before Explore queries]
b.	Have to find out why the player stops on rerender.
i.	Can try to remove the code for lastPodcastPlaying & then, see what happens.
c.	Have to block TrackPlayer from stopping.
d.	Have to SET_PODCAST the queried podcast & MOST IMPORTANT, have to open the PlayerControl as default.
SOLUTION: After 3-4 hours of drilling into TrackPlayer issues, I was unable to solve this until it struck my mind that if I could send the app in background on back button press, then it may work.And it did work. 
So, for the above I had to make changes to Main_activity & AndroidManifest
Once try to use launchMode as singleTask & check working because previously it was singleTask only.
[This is working.]

b.	To keep last 10 means everytime we listen to a podcast, tthe 11th latest podcast’s data has to be deleted from user’s private document.
c.	Basically we need map kind of things,i.e, podcastID -> lastPlayedTime inside user’s private document.
i.	We can encode both in a single array item OR
ii.	We can have separate arrays - basically 1 for ID & 1 for podcast.

OR
I can keep the slideUp in the Image’s TouchableOpacity & run the app in release mode in order to check whether it works okay in release mode. [Working in RELEASE]
b.	Also check in release mode, the sliding of podcastPlayer, not tapping at the position required but sliding to it. [Working in RELEASE]

3.	Upload option for audio in flips [onHold]
a.	Tried various options but no advancement till now.
b.	React-native-sound,react-native-sound-player,react-native-audio
c.	NOTE:- Current status & next steps are written in FlipPreviewScreen in playAudio() function.
4.	GIF upload in flips & podcasts
a.	Some GIF files can be very large. Such files are not only bad for our client (react-native) as it causes performance issues, but also these are bad for our storage.
b.	GIF resizing cannot be done using normal react-native-image-resizer.On react-native we have no library currently that does resizing of GIFs.
c.	Gifsicle is a node js library which allows resizing of GIFs, so it can be used to resize GIFs in our cloud function code.
d.	But when we resize 18 MB GIF to produce 1 MB GIF, nothing is visible...So, as per investigation into other apps uploading GIFs, tumblr currently has a 5 MB limit on compressed GIFs. So, currently I have imposed a limit of 1 MB.
e.	We can increase this limit if we can call cloud function & resize the GIF using gifsicle, but even then we have to keep limit to 2-3 MB only, so that the GIF is presentable in the app.

3.	Try update flow so that user is directly taken to playstore with UPDATE being shown there. [NOT Happening..will have to investigate this] → [UPDATE option will be shown only when previous version has been downloaded from Playstore itself.
If we simply run in release mode from VS code, then in that case it will not show UPDATE option in Playstore..Instead it will show OPEN only.
For seeing UPDATE option first install the app from playstore, then rollout new release,

NOTES:-
(a)	 Not related to MusicProvider
Even on removing MusicProvider in App.js, the problem still persists.
(b)	 Maybe it is the Animated.useNativeDriver thing OR maybe there are multiple TrackPlayer Instances which is causing this problem.
		SOLUTION:-
			Works fine in Release mode, problems visible only in     DEBUG mode.
2.	Home Screen Design -  [DONE..will have to verify in DEBUG once since now there are only 19 flips]

Tasks for 18-07-2020

1.	Fix Bugs
a.	Image resize mode problem 
i.	Description:- On opening MainFlipItem, only for the first time, we are having proper picture size...after that everytime we are observing wrong image size in MainFlipItem [DONE] - 09:42 AM
ii.	SOLUTION:- Calculating resizeModes in useEffect of MainFlipItem instead of calculating in useEffect of FlipItem.
b.	Forgot password BUG
i.	Description:- App crashing when none of email & password are filled & user chooses for ‘Forgot Password’ [DONE] - 09:56 AM
ii.	SOLUTION:- send password reset email only when email.length!=0
c.	Have to find out scenario when audio flip is being clicked but podcast is still playing. [on DEBUG database] [DONE on 20/07/2020 01:34 PM]
i.	So, this can be reproduced if we play a flip, then pause it, & then play a different flip & then play the 1st one again.
ii.	We can see that both audio flips are showing pause symbol, but only 1 is playing.
iii.	SOLUTION:- So, when the user is pausing an audioFlip, then ‘player’ variable (which maintains a state as to what to do when play icon is pressed) was not changed because if user wants to play the paused flip again, then it should resume from where it was paused.
But because of this when we try to play this flip(which was played before & paused) when some other flip is playing, then it simply calls - “TrackPlayer.play()” which does nothing as it resumes the already playing flip. That’s why the icon is changed but the track that was played was not changed.

So for solving this, in onPress function of play icon:-
if(player == false)
was changed to
if(player == false || (player == true && props.item.flipID != currentFlipID))
Which meant that we start the audio flip from start when play icon is pressed & some other flip is playing at that time.
